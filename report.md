Course: C# Development SS2025 (4 ECTS, 3 SWS)

Student ID: cc231030

BCC Group: A

Name: Erath Niklas

## Methodology: 
I have a program class which contains the main function and the base functionallity of the program. Inside the main function i created the if states for the terminal/user inputs to start either the recursive or the iterative method with error messages. Besides that i create 3 stacks - for each rod - and add all the disks to the start rod (left = start, middle = middle, right = final)





## Additional Features
I implemented an Animation class with draw methods to visualize the Tower of Hanoi

## Discussion/Conclusion
The first challenge was to get to know the Tower of Hanoi because i've never heard of it before. But after i watched some youtube videos i got the idea of how it works. I started with the recursion because it was easier for me and started to draw the logic mathematically on a paper. The Iretation instead was more tough for me to complete. At the beginning i felt lost and didn't know where to start. At this point i have to say - thank stack overflow and copilot! Those two helped me a lot to get an understanding of how iterations work and the logic behind it. 

## Work with: 
I worked alone during the nights. 

## Reference: 
I used explaination videos on youtube to get the idea of how the tower of hanoi works.
