## About The Project
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a set of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules. This project provides both recursive and iterative solutions to the Tower of Hanoi problem, with a terminal visualization to illustrate each move.

### Built With
- C#
- .NET Core
- Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- you have to install .NET Core SDK: You can download it from (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
### Installation
- open the code in visual studio code and open the terminal
- type cde TowerOfHanoi/hanoi to get to the project directory

### Usage
- to run the program, use the follwoing commands: 
  for recursive: dotnet run -recursive 3 or the number of disks you want 
  for iterative: dotnet run -iterative 3 or the number of disks you want

## Roadmap 
Start the program with a designed interface.
